Descripton:
This is a repo for random tool scripts that I use in my day to day stuff.

Scripts: 


-newscript.sh:

     Description:
     This script is used to create other scripts. instead of making a file, setting it to /bin/bash, adding the date, and making it  excutable; this script does all of that for you

     Use:
     the script works by taking the first option you give the command and creating a file with that name. it then writes some basic stuff to the file and makes it excutable.
     EX: $./newscript HelloWorld.sh
     
     
-setstatic
  IN PROGRESS
