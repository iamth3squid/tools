This is a repo for random tool scripts that I use in my day to day stuff.




-newscript.sh:

     Description:
     gerates a new bash file with datime and file path of bash. Instead of making a new file, setting it to /bin/bash, adding the date, and making it excutable; this script does all of that for you.

     Use:
     takes the first option you give and creates a file with that name, Then writes some basic stuff to the file and makes it excutable.
     
     EX: $./newscript HelloWorld.sh
     
     

  

-getrepo

     Description:
     used to get repos from github without having to remember the full url.
     
     Use:
     use a link to a github repo as the first option for the script
     
     EX: $ ./getrepo github.com/GITACCOUNT/REPO
     
     

 More to come...
